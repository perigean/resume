-Real-Time programming
  -x86 real-time OS, message passing micro-kernel in C
  -used FreeType to rasterize glyphs for display in graphical modes
  -control model trains with a buggy RS232 serial port
-Introduction to Computer Graphics
  -OpenGL immediate mode, fixed function pipeline graphics programming in C++
  -Wrote a ray tracer that used LUA as a model format to allow for transform stacks and instancing
  -Wrote a side scrolling game with real-time lighting and destructible terrain implemented with a portal engine
-Medical Imaging
  -Image registration and image processing using FFT/convolutions in Matlab

Software Developer Engineer Intern, Hyper-V Performance Team 
-Wrote sampling profiler that worked across VMs and the Hypervisor using hardware Performance Monitoring Counters
-Used the profiler to reduce CPU activity in idle VMs

Okino Computer Graphics
Intern Import Pipeline Developer
-Created an import plugin to pull CAD models from SolidWorks using multiple COM APIs
-Wrote STL like C++ templated containers to hide the above COM API
-Used a KD-Tree to stitch together broken geometry into a contiguous model

Platform Solutions Inc.
Microcode Developer Intern
-Implemented templates for IBM 390 and Z/Architecture instructions in Intel Itanium assembly for a JIT machine code converting emulator
-Hand assembled IBM 390 instructions in memory to debug the above templates
-Wrote a tool to create a listing file for Itanium assembly using Flex and Bison.
-The listing was in HTML and CSS to implement syntax highlighting and links to definitions
